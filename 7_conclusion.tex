% Kort minne om motivasjon, problemstilling, og spørsmål. Mer om resultatene, litt mer i dybden. Outlook. 

\section{Future Work}
\label{future_work}

% Would have liked to work more on this for another year.
% Train lisbon parser with information from our frame classification

There are several experiments that we could run in order to push the accuracy scores even further. A step that the we would like to pursue further is to examine how \textit{Word Representations in Vector Space} might improve the accuracy of our classifier. Concatenating the vectors of approaches from \citeA{word2vec}: Word2Vec, and \citeA{glove}: Glove, with the feature vectors used for our training, would be an interesting approach. A more recent approach by \citeA{sense2vec}: Sence2Vec, which was used by the authors for word sense disambiguation, would be particularly interesting for feature enhancement.
