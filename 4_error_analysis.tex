In this chapter we will examine the results of SemEval-2015 for the Peking, Turku and Lisbon systems described in the previous chapter. The aim of this study is to evaluate the type of errors that state-of-the-art data-driven semantic dependency parsers make. We will first argue the deciding factors behind the choice of these three parsing systems.
