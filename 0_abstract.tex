This thesis presents an in-depth contrastive error analysis of a set of semantic dependency parsing systems. Based on the empirical results of our analysis we found semantic frame classification to be an interesting case study. As part of this thesis we have made a semantic frame classifier that outperforms previous results. The semantic frame classifier is the result of rigorous experimentation with four set of features: (1) lexical, (2) morphological, (3) syntactic, and (4) semantic. We show that our results outperform previous results. We also show that our classifier can be used to extend and improve the frame semantic classification accuracy of two existing state-of-the-art semantic dependency parsing systems.

% This thesis presents a systematic, empirical investigation of how an existing PoS tag set can be modified and optimized for the task of syntactic dependency parsing of Norwegian. The tag set of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank is modified and optimized through experiments with the morphological features in the treebank. The experiments are complemented by evaluation of a range of state-of- the-art PoS taggers and syntactic parsers applied to Norwegian. The results of our work are concrete contributions to the Norwegian NLP community: (i) a data set split (training/development/test) of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank; (ii) a PoS tag set optimized for syntactic dependency parsing of Norwegian; (iii) a PoS tagger model trained on the treebank; and (iv) a syntactic parser model trained on the treebank.
