This thesis is submitted for the degree of Master of Science at the University of Oslo. My supervisors have been Stephan Oepen and Lilja Ã˜vrelid. I am thankful for their insights, helpful advice and patience. They encouraged me to keep going when I felt like I was not going anywhere.

I want to thank my good friend, fellow student, and co-worker Petter Hohle for proofreading and being a great motivator. I thank my girlfriend Marit for encouragement and support.
