Semantic dependency parsing is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that aims at producing 
meaning representations at the sentence-level. We can state the aims of semantic dependency parsing
as a way of expressing predicate-argument relations in order to answer the question of
\textit{Who did What to Whom}. In this regard there is certainly an overlap between semantic dependency
parsing and semantic role labeling, which is concerned with the task of detecting the arguments of a 
predicate in a sentence.
