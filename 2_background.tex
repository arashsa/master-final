This chapter provides an introduction to dependency grammar and reviews the state-of-the-art in
dependency-based parsing. We start by exploring dependency grammar from a historical point 
of view, thus giving the reader insight into the theoretical foundations of dependency parsing. 
We then look at various approaches to dependency parsing. We differentiate dependency 
parsing into two main approaches: a grammar-driven and a data-driven approach. 
These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and as we shall see, there are approaches
that are based on both. We then examine the difference between syntactic and semantic dependency
parsing.
