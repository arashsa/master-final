\label{chap:background}

This chapter provides an introduction to dependency grammar and a review of the state-of-the-art in 
dependency-based parsing. We start by exploring dependency grammar from a historical point of view,
thus giving the reader some insight into the foundations of the early attempts at dependency parsing.
We differentiate dependency parsing into two main approaches: a grammar-driven and a data-driven approach.
These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and as we shall see, there are approaches that are based
on both. We also differentiate between syntactic and semantic dependency parsing.
