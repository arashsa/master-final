\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

This chapter provides an introduction to dependency grammar and reviews the state-of-the-art in
dependency-based parsing. We start by exploring dependency grammar from a historical point 
of view, thus giving the reader insight into the theoretical foundations of dependency parsing. 
We then look at various approaches to dependency parsing. We differentiate dependency 
parsing into two main approaches: a grammar-driven and a data-driven approach. 
These two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and as we shall see, there are approaches
that are based on both. We then introduce syntactic and semantic dependency
parsing, and discuss what differentiates the two approaches. As a superficial 
starting point we can state that the dependency relations in the former are represented 
predominantly by a \textit{tree} data structure, while the latter are represented 
by a \textit{graph} data structure. This chapter formally describes these two approaches
to dependency parsing as a basis for our thesis.

\section{Dependency Grammar}
The early roots of dependency grammar can possibly be traced back to P\={a}\d{n}ini's grammar
of Sanskrit written in approximately 300 BC \cite{Kruijff:02}. However, the modern study of 
dependency grammar is first presented in the works of \citeA{Tes:15}.
